## Who are you?

Passionate about IT for 10 years now üßê, I am in my second year of a Master of Science (M2) in Cybersecurity Expertise with Guardia Cybersecurity School, doing an apprenticeship. I hold the position of an apprentice CISO, with my main tasks related to SOC analyst work, Digital Forensics, and Incident Response (DFIR).

Through the encounters and numerous discussions I've had with various professionals, coming from a systems and networks background, I decided to specialize in cybersecurity.

My experience in security began with a year of apprenticeship in a professional insurance company. I assisted the Information System Security Manager in managing and deploying system updates on servers and user workstations, managing and remediating the company's attack surface and vulnerabilities, implementing compliance with CIS Intune and Windows server standards, and managing, implementing, and monitoring the IT supervision project.

I also migrated obsolete systems to a more recent version, including Windows Server (roles and corresponding data) and domain controllers (Active Directory) with DHCP Failover.

## What is docs.contactit.fr?

A memo of the training I have attended, advice from speakers and trainers, and theoretical and practical experiences.  
I thought, why not put it online and share this knowledge with everyone.

## Why docs.contactit.fr?

I had the idea to create a "showcase" site primarily aimed at businesses.

I enjoy writing, laying out what I've learned, and sharing it. A lot of documentation is available online, but it's often confusing and outdated.

So I decided to create a subdomain `docs.contactit.fr` to write documentation enhanced with tips here and there.

## How did you build docs.contactit.fr?

With the **FOSS** project: **retype**! An excellent **static file generator** for presentations and documentation.

The developers are very active and respond to community feedback and suggestions [on GitHub](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype/issues).

The configuration files use **Yaml** syntax, and the content uses **Markdown**.

The project is available on GitHub at this address: [https://github.com/retypeapp/retype](https://github.com/retypeapp/retype)  
The documentation is on the website: [https://retype.com/](https://retype.com/)

The entire `docs.contactit.fr` is **open-source** (MIT license) and available on **GitHub** at this address: [https://github.com/didntchooseaname/docs.contactit.fr](https://github.com/didntchooseaname/docs.contactit.fr)

## Interesting, can I drop you a message?
